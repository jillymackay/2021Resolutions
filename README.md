# 2021Resolutions

I made a series of new year's resolutions for 2021, and I want to try and visualise my progress on some of them. 

## Resolution 1: 30 Minutes Writing
I resolve to write at least 30 minutes of fiction a day. I'm recording:

 * Day and month
 * Words written that day
 * Genre of writing
 * Title of piece
 * Words written that day
